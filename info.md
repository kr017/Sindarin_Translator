React DOM is for browser
so for react native it wont be there




index.html  -->  index.js  --> app.js (imports styles.css)



in react for styling we use className not class since we are 

style takes object


declarative and imperative



If you want to return more than one value return wither an array or object

useState 
it is a function
how to call -> 
   useState(0)   //initial value is zero 
which returns an array
const [likeCounter,setLikeCounter]=useState(0)  
 //here 0 is initial value of variable meansn likeCounter
 since useState() returns two values we are returning an array




 VISER 
 ->(render)view i.e. 1st view 
 ->interact(with view)which is done by onClick 
 ->state(update state in eventHandler) i.e. function likeClickHanler
 ->render i.e. resulting view
